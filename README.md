# turbo rails

This is some work I did for the [Turbo Rails Tutorial](https://www.hotrails.dev/turbo-rails) at [hotrails.dev](https://www.hotrails.dev)

Also experimented with some rails setup that I like or wanted to investigate (strict_loading_by_default, destroy_async, dotenv things)

Putting it here for future reference.

Using:
- Rails 7.1
- Ruby 3.3
- [Hotwire](https://hotwired.dev) (Turbo, Stimulus)
- [Simpleform](https://github.com/heartcombo/simple_form)
- Rubocop & Standard a la [Evil Martians](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/rubocoping-with-legacy-bring-your-ruby-code-up-to-standard)

Possible experiments:
- Hotwire Strada / native apps
- switch to propshaft
